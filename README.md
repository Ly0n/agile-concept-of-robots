Development Mindsets, Processes and Methods in Robotics

> No process, mindset and method will fit to your unique working enviroment and team without a common adaption.

## Mindsets and Experiences 
### Conway's law
`Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.` (1967)

### The Mythical Man-Month or Brooks's law

`Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.` (1975)

The modern practices of continuous integration, test-driven development, and iterative development significantly reduce the inter-developer communication overhead, and thus allow for better scalability.

### Unix Philosophy

`Concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a "software tools" movement` (1978)

* Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
* Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.
* Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
* Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.

### Agile Manifesto  

`Representatives from Extreme Programming, SCRUM, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, Pragmatic Programming, and others sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes convened` (2001)

**My personal favourites:**
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
